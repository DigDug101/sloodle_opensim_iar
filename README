This repo is for the IAR archive of the SLOODLE rezzer.

The contents of the IAR archive is stored in decompressed form.
To import it into an OpenSim grid, you need to archive it with tar / gzip.

Example:

# Go into the directory containing the IAR. 
cd iar/

# Archive the contents as a file called /tmp/sloodle.iar.
# NB OpenSim may choke on the archive unless the files are archived in the specified order.
tar zcvf /tmp/sloodle.iar archive.xml inventory/ assets/

# In the OpenSim console, you should now be able to load the archive:
load iar Your Avatar / yourpassw0rd /tmp/sloodle.iar
