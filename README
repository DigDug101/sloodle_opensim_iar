This repo is for the IAR archive of the SLOODLE rezzer.

The contents of the IAR archive is stored in decompressed form.
To import it into an OpenSim grid, you need to archive it with tar / gzip.

Example:

# Go into the directory containing the IAR. 
cd iar/

# Archive the contents as a file called /tmp/sloodle.iar.
# NB OpenSim may choke on the archive unless the files are archived in the specified order.
# Also it prefers the directory/* formulation to avoid spurious errors.
tar zcvf /tmp/sloodle.iar archive.xml inventory/* assets/*

# In the OpenSim console, you should now be able to load the archive:
load iar Your Avatar / yourpassw0rd /tmp/sloodle.iar


To recreate this iar and update the Git repo, do the following:

# Make a directory in inventory - recommend iar/export/sloodle

# Make a directory on the disk that the opensim user can write to - recommend /tmp/iar/export
mkdir /tmp/iar/export

# In the OpenSim console, export the iar: 
save iar Your Avatar /iar/export/sloodle/ yourpassw0rd /tmp/iar/export/sloodle.iar

# Remove the contents of the current iar directory, and unpack the new iar instead.
rm -rf iar/*
cd iar
tar zxvf /tmp/iar/export/sloodle.iar

# Tell Git to accept all the changes, commit and push
git add .
git commit -a
git push
